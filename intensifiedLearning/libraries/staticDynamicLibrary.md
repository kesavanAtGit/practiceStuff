static library and dynamic library

static library becomes one with the executable
since for every exe a copy is made, this tend to waste a lot of space.

dynamic library gets linked at the run time
the copy problem does not exist here

import library helps in automating the process of using a dynamic or static library in your program

find the library download and compile it
tell the compiler where to look for the header files
tell the linker where to look for the library files
#include the header files in your program

use the shit out of it now
